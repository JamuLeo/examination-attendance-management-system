EXAMINATION ATTENDANCE MOBILE APP

This app replaces the manual registration system, which is time-consuming. It allows the instructor to simply scan the student ID and verify or search manually by name or registration number.

Firstly, the academic instructor needs to download the Android app from the Expo official site: https://expo.dev/accounts/zainhutsle/projects/examination-attendance-management-system/builds/41dc2773-847d-4a9e-ad6d-b3bb4311f6ef.

Once the app is installed, allow the phone's camera permission to access the scanning functionality in the app.
The user is given an email and password for login to the app for identification and authentication.

So far, we have only two users (academic instructors):

User: admin311@gmail.com
Password: FGBR56
User: admin312@gmail.com
Password: FGBR57
The academic instructor specifies the department, course, venue, and time.

The academic instructor can scan the student ID or search manually in CheckIn or CheckOut.

The academic instructor can access the Google Sheet to view the attendance of students, but in view mode only.
